## Overview

This repository includes scripts that automate tasks such as AWS profile
management, device handling, and more. The scripts are organized into a
compact library file (`scripts.ar`) to make distribution easy and
efficient. Each script is documented and designed for ease of use,
customization, and flexibility.

## Getting Started

### Steps to Set Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
mkdir ~/scripts && cd ~/scripts 

git clone git@github.com:jcgarcia/scripts.git

```
2.  Run the setup script:

```bash

./installscripts
```
3.  The setup script will:

    -   Verify that all required components are present, including
        README.md, README.pdf, .jcscripts, installscript, and
        lib/scripts.ar.

    -   Extract scripts from the scripts.ar library into the directory
        specified in .jcscripts (default: ~/scripts).

    -   Make valid shell scripts executable.

    -   Add the scripts directory to your system's PATH for easy
        access.

4.  After installation, you can call any script directly by its name
    from any location:

```bash

script_name
```
## Configurations

The `.jcscripts` file contains configuration options for the scripts repository. Below are the configurable values:

- **EDITOR**: Specifies the text editor for editing scripts (default: `vi`).
- **SCRIPTS_DIR**: Defines the directory where the scripts will be stored (default: `~/scripts`).
- **SSH_KEY**: Path to the SSH key for accessing GitHub (default: `~/.ssh/personalkey.pem` you must generate your own key and change that in the config file).

### Generating an SSH Key

To generate your own SSH key:

1. Run the provided script, and follow the prompts to create the key.
  
```bash
   ./generate_ssh_key
```


2. Follow the prompts to create the key.


- Copy the contents of the public key file (~/.ssh/personalkey.pem.pub):

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/personalkey.pem.pub
```
- Log in to GitHub and navigate to Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > New SSH Key.
[Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?form=MG0AV3)


- Paste the contents into the Key field, give it a meaningful title, and save.

**Additional Notes**

If the setup script detects that the environment has already been

running installscripts.
